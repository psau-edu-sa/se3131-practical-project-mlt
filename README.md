## Formal specification for a traffic lights using petri net
Using Petri net, we gonna formalize the following system:

We have a traffic intersection that regulates the flow of four different lanes, Only certain signals can be green at a specific time and the rest are red,

The signs should work in an orderly manner according to the numbering shown in the image, which can be described as follows:

- The two signals in lanes 1 can be green at the same time, and the rest of the signals are red.

- The two lights in lanes 2 can be green at the same time, and the rest of the lights are red.

- The signal in lane 3 can be green and the rest of the lights are red.

- The signal in lane 4 can be green and the rest of the lights are red.

- The signals in lane 5 allow cars to reverse traffic when it does not interfere with another signal.

## The goal of the system
The system must be designed so that the traffic lights must operate in an orderly manner according to the numbering.
